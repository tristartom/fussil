FuSSIL Labs: FUll-stack Systems programming and Security Instructional Labs
===

FuSSIL labs are designed as a platform for teachers to design educational labs and demos for the active learning of systems programming and systems security concepts. 

FuSSIL covers a number of topics in the full stack of a computer system, including OS programming (processes, IO, sockets), web infrastructures (HTTP, TLS, DNS), and P2P/blockchain infrastructures.

- OS systems programming & security
    1. File IO related code
    1. Processes related code
    1. Sockets related code
- Web programming
- P2P/blockchain programming

Currently, this repository contains a collection of minimalist examples written in `C` to demo the above scenarios.

FuSSIL has been used in a undergraduate Computer-Science core course, CSE 384 ("Introduction to Systems and Network Programming"), at Syracuse University: https://tristartom.github.io/teaching/cse384/
